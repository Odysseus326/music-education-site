<h2>Find a music teacher perfect for you!</h2>

<p>This project (still untitled) is part of a vision where inexperienced individuals who aspire to learn an instrument or get involved in their local music community can use a website to connect with a trained instructor.<p>

<p>The music world is fiercly a "who you know" world, where people who weren't lucky enough to attend a college music program or be raised as a musician find it nearly impossible to get started in their adulthood, or even earlier!</p>

<p>On top of that, music stores like to act as a "middleman" between teachers and students, often charging up to double what the teacher would normally charge for their services.</p>

<p>This website is going to be a place where well-known instructors in your area can list themselves as being available to teach YOU.</p>

<p>You can search by instrument, by location, by genres of music, and even filter more niche categories, like composition or hyperspecific instruments (steel pan, rudimental drums, etc.).</p>

<p>This website will also feature a dashboard useful for teachers and students to stay on the same page. Listing material, sending updates & messages, scheduling, even billing. This website intends to be a one-stop-shop for an educator and their studio of students, and also aims to make it more affordable than ever to pay for lessons.</p>
